        "description": "Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these Bike Sharing systems, people rent a bike from one location and return it to a different or same place on need basis. People can rent a bike through membership (mostly regular users) or on demand basis (mostly casual users). This process is controlled by a network of automated kiosk across the city.", // Description of the article

        "description": "Recently, I needed to work with Spark dataframes having Map datatypes for one of our projects. I realized that Map and Array are the two most commonly used datatypes. So, I explored in detail how can we create, query, explode and implode columns of array and map datatypes. I created this notebook to be a handy reference for myself. Please feel free to checkout this notebook if you also need something quick and handy while working with these nested datatypes.",
